Triumpet is an indoor mapping application. For more context, check out Chi Kei Chan's Blog Post:  ["Triumpet - Indoor Mapping"](https://chikeichan.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/triumpet-indoor-mapping/), and what we learned about effective scoping. In short, we aimed super high: wanting to reverse-engineer sensor fusion with phone gyroscope/accelerometer data. Realizing that was impossible in such a short time, we re-scoped to using iBeacons, and when that proved too challenging, ended up focusing on a clean user experience in Angular, and performant back-end in Mongo/Mongoose and Node. 

I worked with Devin Otway and Jacky Chan, two bright and extremely hard-working software engineers. This post will be about my experience doing a deep dive into testing frameworks. See Jacky's post on how we originally scoped down from something much more ambitious.

Main high level takeaways from the project: 
-Team communication and buy-in is crucial, especially in small teams.
-Make sure everyone is heard, but be decisive and ruthless about preventing feature bloat. Cut scope early and quickly.

I worked briefly in the Angular front-end and Mongo server back-end, but as a team we decided it would be a great chance for someone to do a deep dive into various testing frameworks. Encouraged by instructor support at Hack Reactor, I jumped at the chance to fill this role.  

Working with Chai allowed me to understand different testing practices (I prefer BDD-style 'expect' chaining, over 'should', or the TDD 'assert' style). I was able to think about and make decisions regarding what tests to write given our time constraints. I also got to try my hand at a few end-to-end tests with new technology, signing up a new user on the front-end with Protractor/Selenium. 

I came away from the project with a sense of the inherent conflicts between testing and moving quickly. It motivated me to read more about testing and how the industry as a whole viewed it, also tihnking about best practieces on a meta level.

I could finally connect my reading of the Million-Man Month, and the treatises on building large projects at scale,  to real project experiences. More importantly, I began to form an appreciation for how testing frames and streamlines one's thinking, something that would serve me well on my next project, fitMunk. The short version of that story:
-I was struggling to refactor a back-end API from Firebase to Mongo.
-Stepping back and writing some quick-and-dirty unit tests allowed me to see the big picture and make incremental progress, successfully completing the refactor in an all-night coding session that same night.


I'd eventually do a [presentation](https://sdtsui.com/2015/03/28/coverage-presentation/) on code coverage in Istanbul & Coveralls.io.


Overall, this was a highlight learning experience at Hack Reactor. We met almost every day and hacked, despite it being a solo/break week for Hack Reactor. I got to see a bunch of the city, and woke up every day excited to code. As Jacky mentioned in his reflective post-hack reactor blog, "It is possible to go to work everyday with a smile on my face, as if I am just going to work out my brain." Perhaps 'excited to code' is inaccurate. I'd like to express my experience with and something less indicative of affect/conscious choice, and more suggestive of effortless, habitual enjoyment. Anyway, that's a post for another time.

Technically, many of the things we did I would not consider challenging now.
However, I learned so many things I will continue to apply to future projects/challenges.

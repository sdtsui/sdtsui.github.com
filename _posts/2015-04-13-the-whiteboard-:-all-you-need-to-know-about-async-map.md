Introducing The Whiteboard, and some guest blogging!

#The Whiteboard: All You Need to Know About Async Map

The Whiteboard is an ongoing blog series about technical interviews and interview questions. Whiteboard posts will take less than 10 minutes to read, and they aim to help junior and intermediate software engineers preparing for technical interviews. Readers are encouraged to follow along by whiteboarding, ideally with a pen and legal pad. In order to simulate a real practice interview environment, solution code won't be provided. Readers are not encouraged to look up an answer online until they've given it a solid shot.

[See Part I of The Whiteboard, on Ryan Leung's Blog](http://www.minocys.com)! The problem is asyncMap, a common technical interview question.

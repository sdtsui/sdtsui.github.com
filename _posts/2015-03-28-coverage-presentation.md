[![Code Coverage Talk](https://nodei.co/npm/istanbul.png?downloads=true)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLb1uEs0qs)

Last week I did a short remote presentation to other Hackers in Residence. The topic was Code Coverage in Istanbul. I have very little experience with public speaking. I had limited preparation time and it was one of the first times I presented on a technical topic. Despite a slight technical difficulty in the middle, I was able to get through the whole thing on time and field a few questions. 

It felt great to get out of my comfort zone.  I was encouraged by the experience, and can see myself investing effort at a later date, to polish my presentation and public speaking skills.

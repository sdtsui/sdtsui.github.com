Fourball was a student project I did at Hack Reactor, with my fellow cohort-mates Nick Sippl-Swezey, Philip Rosen, and Wayne Muller. We built a clean, user-friendly app that tied together multiple APIs (Google Maps, Twilio, and MongoDB's Geospatial Querying). It was motivating to build something we could touch (and send real-time SMS with!).

A great learning moment during this project period was when I found that, after much trial and error, MongoDB's documents were wrong. Unit conversion between [radians and distance](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes/
) was not behaving as expected, and a few Stack Overflow posts confirmed that the docs were wrong. I needed to write an internal conversion function into our back-end. 

I'll have to go back into the Fourball code when I have more free time and submit the PR to mongodb's docs, and this blog post is a great reminder.

Working on the front-end, I came away awed by how easy it is to do hybrid app development. Ionic has beautiful components that work out of the box, and an active community. Judging from how closely they're [working with the Angular Team](http://blog.ionic.io/angular-2-ionic/), I'm excited to see what's next for them.  It's a joy to work with fast, well-designed frameworks. This project experience convinced me to commit to deep dives of both React Native, and Angular 2 (when realased).

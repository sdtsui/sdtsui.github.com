I was introduced to this game by a group of seniors, at Hack Reactor’s first after hours event. It was extremely easy to pick up, and is more fun with additional players. It’s also a stimulating programming problem.

I heard that [a solver](http://www.michaelfogleman.com/ricochet/) existed. I found this: a python implementation that uses a recursive brute force algorithm. I think it’s cool that the average number of solution moves is 6-7, a good starting point for searches during a casual game.

Check out the blog for an explanation of the rules.

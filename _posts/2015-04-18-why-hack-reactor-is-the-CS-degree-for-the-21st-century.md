This is the unedited version of a review I submitted to Yelp.com. You can read the original review, without pictures, [here](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hack-reactor-san-francisco?hrid=06kOoVsYWc8htQkRaFEdfg). There's a more introspecive blog coming up, so consider this Part I.


## First contact:

Look up "Marcus Philips, JSConf 2014", and watch the training track he does on JavaScript fundamentals. Notice how he isn't simply working through a speech and augmenting it with visual aids. He engages his audience.  He tailors the lecture's content to the room's level of comprehension. No two live lectures at Hack Reactor are exactly the same. That level of dynamism, polish, and attention to detail exemplifies the school's teaching philosophy.


## Biggest positives:

Teaching methods and curriculum are 100% industry relevant. Context, meta-perspectives, methods, and personalized support mold students into the best, highest performing versions of themselves.  Students are encouraged to be autonomous learners and to figure out what they love about the field, creating sustainable sources of motivation while pushing their limits.

The people. Staff and students are amazing. My cohorts had former traders, an international dance teacher, ivy leaguers with advanced postgraduate degrees, and an FIDE Chess Master. All Hack Reactor grads are hireable, and always seem to have some other exceptional non-technical talents or depth of experience that make them valuable on a team.

Hack Reactor, as it is today, is the product of a long journey from tiny startup serving a class of 8, to elite engineering academy. Wherever modern education goes, there's a good chance that many of the good parts will, by design or accident, be emulating the processes that Hack Reactor has discovered and now continues to perfect. The Hiring Team tells us to phrase our training as an "Advanced Software Engineering Immersive", because "coding boot camp" doesn't quite do it justice. I couldn't agree more: Hack Reactor is in another league.


## Biggest negatives:

It's all on you. Your technical and personal growth are your responsibility. It is hard. Weeks 1-5, I spent 100% of my waking hours in the two block radius around Hack Reactor.  You will feel inadequate or overwhelmed at some point. It is not for everyone.

H/R's original name was simply "Catalyst". While being an overall crappier name, the word does a better job of suggesting what goes on inside. Magic happens when you put a bunch of smart people in a hugely supportive environment, convince them to have no social lives and to dedicate 80+ hours a week. They're not grinding it out just to get a job. They're training to be effective as software engineers, communicators, team members, and individuals.

The founders have gotten multiple acquisition offers and could have sold the company long ago. They claim to continue to reinvest in the school, making every aspect of it better. I believe them because at every turn level during my time at a student, I've had interactions that were great for my professional & personal development. 



## Some examples:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/soSO7d6.jpg" width="550" height="450"/>

- The interview process was pleasant and representative of the learning environment.  They took it seriously. I was judged on the merit of the code I wrote in the technical interview, and on my verbal communication skills.  I don't think anyone ever saw my face. 
- Precourse support: They've packed weeks of instruction, some of which used to be in the program, into a massively valuable curated resource. Relative to my baseline learning rate as a beginner, I saved 100+ hours studying from that resource.
- Week 1: Hell Week, complete with 30-40  lectures. From JavaScript best practices, to 'how to think like & succeed as an engineer', to pair programming instruction. I remember finishing Week 1, thinking the value of all of those lectures amortized over the next 40 years of my life must dwarf the cost of tuition.

I could type a paragraph or two on the rest of these things, but it keeps going:
- I got professional and personal advice I'll easily continue to get value from over the next ten years, from talking to staff during their office hours.
- Over a dozen intense sprints on specific, high-value technologies, all while pair programming.
- Weekly check-ins to monitor the cohort's emotional health and suggest tweaks/brainstorm ideas.
- Project periods: autonomous hacking and regular support from technical mentors.
- Resume building & personal narrative sprints that rivals the best personal products/consulting you can buy.
- Hiring day, job search coaching/support, and salary negotiation. 
- Finally, lifetime camaraderie with a tight-knit and growing clan of Hack Reactor alumni.

In closing, here are some patterns I noticed. These patterns were either events, or direct quotes uttered unprompted throughout the course by multiple students/alumni. I hope they make points I'm nowhere near a competent enough writer to elucidate.

- "The curriculum, student experience, and student outcomes are constantly improving."
- It's a high-stress learning environment with surprisingly low incidence of burnout, because people love what they do, and staff support them.
- "People work hard here / students consistently stay later than other coding schools."
- "I love being here because of the amazing people."
- Hack Reactor's job search curriculum, resources, and support are 'no joke', 'worth the cost of tuition alone', 'utterly outclass that of ivy league schools', or  'are the best in the world'."
- "A week in Hack Reactor time is like a year in normal time."

Sound good? It gets better. H/R itself is only around two years old. I've already mentioned how the school itself is constantly improving. Grads are beginning to make names for themselves in the industry. Considering the intelligence, drive, and overall potential for badassery, it boggles my mind what they'll accomplish and how the H/R brand will grow as a result. 

Reach out if you're a prospective student or recent graduate. I'd love to connect.

Happy hacking,  
Daniel

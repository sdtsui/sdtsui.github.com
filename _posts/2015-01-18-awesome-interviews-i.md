Whiteboarding is different from solving toy problems in a number of ways.

For most software engineers, foremost of these is the experience of communicating their thoughts without the use of a keyboard and/or editor. This can be a stressful experience: struggling during a whiteboarding session can make it seem like one is unable to solve what is usually a simple algorithmic question, even if coding it would be trivial. That experience is amplified by the interview setting.

Here is one strategy I have used to have great whiteboarding and technical interview experiences.

Think of it like a conversation.

Imagine your interviewer is an old friend, or new coworker, and you are casually exploring a problem together. Do this instead of framing the experience as adversarial, where the interviewer is examining you, the prospective engineer, for defects. It takes the pressure off, but much more importantly, it demonstrates that you are capable of communicating effectively in a normal work environment. This affects your body language, tonality, and general sense of ease throughout the technical interview. It also allows you to respond with grace to mistakes and unexpected nuances of the problem.

Thatâ€™s all I have for now.
Good luck in your technical interviews!

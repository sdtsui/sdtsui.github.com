HR22, hailing from Vancouver, Canada, and one of the few international students who went to SF for the onsite program. I wrote a more personal piece about experience on my blog. Search for me and you will find it, through either my Github or Stack Overflow account. This review focuses on Hack Reactor the school/organization, with less emphasis on my own experience. Suffice to say, I lived and breathed code for 12 weeks, experiencing tremendous technical and personal growth. I observed the same in many of my peers. 

First contact:

Before I arrived, this is what tipped it for me. Look up "Marcus Philips, JSConf 2014", and watch the training track he does on JavaScript fundamentals. It's really hard to come away from one of those lectures without noticing how good of a lecturer Marcus is. He's engaged with his students. He ISN'T simply working through a speech, presenting material to memorize. He's tailoring the lecture to what the room's level of comprehension is at. It's both highly technical, but also an emergent performance. That level of dynamism, polish, and attention to detail exemplifies Hack Reactor's teaching philosophy. And it plays only a small part in explaining why they are so successful.

Biggest positives: 
The admissions team is amazing. Friends of mine have attended coding bootcamps and were dissapointed. Some students seemed more interested in coasting through as an alternative to college. While this is not always representative of every coding bootcamp, those situations exist. For the record: Hack Reactor is in another league. The bottom quartile of Hack Reactor cohorts are gonna get jobs, and always seem to have some other exceptional talents or depth of experience that make them valuable on a team.

Watching your new friends (forged in blood, coffee, and code) have stellar outcomes is heartwarming. I've had cohort-mates tell me about how they hated their jobs before, but now wake up with great optimism regarding their professional futures and lives in general.Another cohort-mate told me his experience here transformed him, essentially from a stay-at-home gamer to someone curious, motivated, and driven to challenge himself and see what he can accomplish with his new technical skills. These are not outlier outcomes. The Hiring Team tells us to phrase our training as an "Advanced Software Engineering Immersive", because "coding bootcamp" doesn't quite do it justice. I couldn't agree more.

I don't know where the future of eduction is going, but there's a good chance wherever it goes, a bunch of the good parts will, either by design or by accident, be emulating a bunch of what Hack Reactor does. 

Biggest negative: It's all on you. All of your technical, and personal growth are your responsibility. Hack Reactor opens the door but you have to step through it.
It's expensive. The magic behind H/R is not that it's all student driven. H/R's original name was simply "catalyst". While being an overall crappier name, it the word does a better job of suggesting what goes on at H/R. Magic happens when you put a bunch of smart people in a hugely supportive environment, convince them to have no social lives and dedicate every waking moment learning 80+ hours a week. 

I've been told the founders have gotten multiple acquisition offers and could have sold the company for a healthy profit long ago. They continue to reinvest in the school, making every aspect of it better, and growing both the enterprise and the brand. Hack Reactor is going to keep getting better. I believe this because at every level during my 12+ week experience, I've had many positive interactions that were great for my development.

Without getting into too much detail:
-The interview process was pleasant.  They took it seriously. I was judged on the merit of the code I wrote in the technical interview, and on my verbal communication skills. I don't think anyone ever saw my face. 
-Precourse support: They've packed weeks of instruction, some of which used to be in the program, into a massively valuable curated resource. I saved hundreds of hours learning what I learned in precourse, relative to what I would have learned as a beginner on my own
-Week 1: Hell Week. We got 30-40 lectures that week. From JavaScript best practices, 'how to think like & succeed as an engineer', to pair programing instruction. I remember finishing Week 1 thinking a the value of all of those lectures ammortized over the next 40 years of my life was have been worth 10k+. 

I could type a paragraph or two on the rest of these things, but it keeps going:
-I got career and personal advice I'll easily continue to get value from over the next 10 years, from talking to staff during their office hours.
-Over a dozen sprints on specific, high-value technology siloes.
-Weekly check-ins to monitor everyone's emotional health.
-Project periods: autonomous hacking and regular support from technical mentors.
-A resume building sprint that rivals the best personal products/consulting you can buy.
-Portfolio/personal narrative sprints
-Job search context, instruction on how to advocate for, and market ourselves.
-Hiring day, job search coaching/support, salary negotation, it just keeps going.
-Finally, lifetime cameraderie with a tight-knit growing clan of Hack Reactor alum...

A senior member of staff told a story. Something of a morale booster. An alum told senior staff on the student outcomes team that despite how good H/R's hiring support is, Princeton's is better. There are some jokes and tomfoolery inbetween, but the story ends with the senior staff member partaking in an epic journey, eventually hiring one of Princeton's former directors of student outcomes. He ended the story reminding us that we have that level of support and dedication for the rest of our lives. As my cohort enters their job searches and continues to report on the great career & negotiation advice they're getting, in addition to the camraderie they find with other H/R grads in the industry, and how applicable the skills they've learned are to their jobs...I have no reason to think that statement isn't true. 

In closing, here are some patterns I noticed, either as common events, or direct quotes uttered unprompted by multiple students, alum, or non-executive staff throughout the course. I hope these patterns make points I'm nowhere near a competent enough writer to elucidate.

-"The curriculum, student experience, and student outcomes have been tweaked like crazy and are constantly improving."
-It's a high stress learning environment with surprisingly low incidence of burnout, due to teamwork and staff support.
-"People work hard here / students consistently stay later than other coding schools."
-"I love being here because of the amazing people."
-Some version of how Hack Reactor's job search curriculum, resources and support are are 'no joke', 'worth the cost of tuition alone', 'utterly outclass that of ivy league schools', or  'are the best in the world'."
-"A week in Hack Reactor time is like a year in normal time..."

Sound good? It gets better.
H/R itself is only around two years old. Grads are just beginning to make names for themselves in the industry. Considering the intelligence, drive, and overall potential for badassery, it boggles my mind what they'll accomplish and how the H/R brand will grow as a result. 

Go if you're given the opportunity. You'll have a blast.  



FINAL CONTEXT:
(hr)



...which brings me to my final point.

Have you ever watched the Dragon Ball TV/cartoon series? There's this thing called the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Oh, man. Let me tell you about the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.  A step over the threshold of the training area brings one immediately into ten times Earth's gravity. Air gets denser and the temperature fluctuates, the deeper one goes. One year inside the chamber is equivalent to one day on the outside. Dragon Ball's protagonists, spiky-haired martial artists, go there to train for fighting tournaments and come out with otherworldly powers. Hack Reactor is as close you're gonna get to that in real life.

I made lifelong friends who have grown as much as I have. Sup JSON, Big Hash, Chancellor, TroutZen, Firebase, Y/W-angular, and many others who don't have nicknames. I'll look to them for personal and technical advice in the future. Amortized over my lifetime, I'm not sure how to compare what my experience at Hack Reactor will pay off YoY. There's no doubt in my mind it's over 10% YoY. Basically, if you want to be a software engineer for the rest of your life, it at least matches the Ivies in ROI. I'm a happier, more content/well-adjusted, and overall better person as a result of attending hack Reactor. The utility of some of the things I've learned could be priceless.

(visa)
As I don't have a bachelor's degree in CS and no other work experience in the industry. I can't legally work in the states. It is both painful and exhilarating, but always motivating, to see my I see my friends, who are my technical peers, getting amazing offers at companies they're excited to work for. The salary stats are real.  If anything , they're dialed down so H/R can argue more effectively against inevitable edge-case arguments.

(admissions, studnets)


*I earnestly tried to find more substantive negatives of the program. They were few, and many seemed beside the point, artificial, or generally broke the flow of the piece. The negatives aspects of the program are out there. Any prospective student should research the program thoroughly before applying. Cliffs: One: All the responsibility to learn and perform is on you. Two: it's expensive-ish.

**It's a remote contract role. Hit me up if you're hiring (remote or otherwise) in the Bay Area. I'll reach out when it ends. Find me on The Googles.

Draft intros...
PART I : 

This is the long-form version of my Google Plus and Yelp reviews. When I can, I'll avoid repeating what I wrote in the organization-facing reviews, and focus on my experience of the program.

(take screenshot, link directly)

"My time spent in the other place has resulted in a finely tuned competence that is still present, but goes unrevealed. My muscles are ready for the long days. My mind seeks the next step on the route. My voice stands by to speak truths and concerns."

I lived and breathed code for 12 weeks, 80-100 hours a week. I experience tremendous technical and personal growth.  I observed the same in my peers. How could I not? They were responsible for much of it.  

Point form, some things I learned or otherwise improved as a direct result of my time at Hack Reactor.

Technology/framework-agnostic, engineering-related skills:
- I care about the user.
A meta-frame how to think about user experience, specifically needs and expectations. It gets drilled into our heads through multiple examples all over the stack. How people will disengage if their expectations are not met. Why they will leave if they have to wait for longer than a second for a page to load on a mobile device (and why mobile users will be the majority of our users).
- I'll add tremendous value to an engineering team.
Effective scoping and workflows. Team communication. Making sure everyone is heard and their needs are being met. Engineering team: maximizing ability to learn and contribute technically, no matter where I am or how junior or senior I am. 
- I can teach myself to learn. Like a magnet, or some kind of crazy physics-defying perpetual motion machine for learning, for the rest of my life, I'll effortlessly gravitate towards environments, projects, and people that will be enriching and high-growth.  I'll constantly challenge myself, either by surrounding myself with people smarter than me, or seeking uncertainty as a proxy for high growth situations.
- I can find solutions to complex problems : I'm able to go from clueless to conversant in a new problem space quite quickly. I can use a whiteboard to augument my thinking process, and bring others in with me on that mental journey. I can iterate quickly on a workable solution. How to use my intuition effectively. How to not get bogged down by premature optimization.
- I can scope & implement solutions. Minimizing feature bloat. The value of testing. Optimizing for developer time.

Non-technical, personal traits:
-Autonomy, task prioritization. As Peter Thiel says: "What is the one, most important thing you could be doing right now?"
-Empathy:  Appreciation of varied skillsets & life experience. Liking people more, and being liked more.
-Effective Motivation: How important energy, likeability and positivity are, not just to your internal state, but the effectiveness of those around.
-Tenacity
-The value of rest and recharging, especialy in emotional and spiritual spheres. Anne Winblad said in 'founders at work', "When you're young, you're kind of superhuman. ... you need people odler and more experienced to tell you you'll be more effective if you take care of yourself, get adequate rest, etc..."
I'm paraphrasing, but the gist of the quote is there, and I can really identify with it now.

Entrepreneurial skills:
- Understanding how engineering should work, and where it fits into an early stage tech startup. It's fucking important, especially as the cost of foudning a tech company continues to go down.
- Hustle. Work until you can't think anymore, rest until you're ready to do it again, see if you can beat yourself. I thought I could work hard before Hack Reactor, holding up my 30 hour poker sessions as badges of honor. The difference in my level of effectiveness now is night and day.


Tracking my development in each of these areas over the last 16-20 weeks has been amazing for my confidence.  On being able to think about the user, and being conversant about scaling issues: 

Midway through in the program I went to a Stellar meetup with a Hacker in Residence, speaking a senior engineer at Stellar. Watching the difference in my confidence, from coding my own janky poker simulations, to understanding 80% of what a professional with 5+ years of experience was saying about database optimization, sharding, and Bookshelf.js/Knex was shocking. I recently had a conversation with a senior engineer in a stealth tech startup, able to ascertain multiple red flags in their engineering team and processes.  I hope to continue growing at this rate. And I use the word 'hope' in it's most optimistic sense: "to look forward to with desire and reasonable confidence".


I'll end with a fun metaphor: the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
HYPERBOLIC TIME CHAMBER:

(me)
The technial & professional roadmap I have constructed for myself from knowledge and experiences gained at Hack Reactor will cause my learning rate over the next five years to be a multiple of my time at university. I'll be able to pick things up quickly and contribute high-quality work wherever I go.  I can make level-headed appraisals of when I'm out my depth. In doing so, I'll be an asset to my superiors and team especially as I continue to prioritize and improve my verbal communication & writing skills. I'm able to think about the end user of the things I build, and not just the technology involved. Thus, I also see a clear path to realizing future entrepreneurial ambitions. I am conversant about scaleability issues, architecture decisions, and software development paradigms. I write tests, and not only in production.

Have you ever watched the Dragon Ball TV/cartoon series? There's this thing called the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Oh, man. Let me tell you about the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.  A step over the threshold of the training area brings one immediately into ten times Earth's gravity. Air gets denser and the temperature fluctuates, the deeper one goes. One year inside the chamber is equivalent to one day on the outside. Dragon Ball's protagonists, spiky-haired martial artists, go there to train for fighting tournaments and come out with otherworldly powers. Hack Reactor is as close you're gonna get to that in real life. Unless you're a runner...there are hyperbaric tents for that.

I made lifelong friends who have grown as much as I have. I'll look to them for personal and technical advice in the future. Amortized over my lifetime, YoY return on tuition cost will easily be over 10%. I'm a happier, more content/well-adjusted, and overall better person as a result of attending hack Reactor. The utility of some of the things I've learned could be priceless.


Hack Reactor Introspective, Part II: 
Picking up from where Part I left off, now would be a good time for an interstitiary photoblog!

I arrive there, carefully carrying the thick, tattered web of bonds I had with my fellows, torn apart and divided up too hurriedly at the parting. All their ghosts are still with me, as they will be for days, and the lot of us barely fit through the door together. 

A photoblog for a change. Here's the upload from my phone, of 
I tried to keep it to pictures of people at work.

FRIENDS:

 Sup JSON, Chancellor, TroutZen, Firebase, W/Y-angular,  Big Hash, SaMEAN-Stack, and many others who don't have nicknames.



PART III: The HiR Report


RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN HiR:

My office, yesterday. Literally. This was my office yesterday. I wrote this blog post sitting in that chair.

The above was where I was at the end of Hack Reactor. I'm a month into the Hacker in Residence program. I spend 20-22 hours a week on Help Desk, responding when students are stuck. I'm finding there's a lot more mentorship, guidance, and soft skills development than I originally thought. I thought I'd just have to know the sprint material really well. It turns out, being an effective communicator, especially one that is able to use a position of seniority to inspire confidence in others, is WAY more important. Students' biggest problems end up being things like "not biased enough to action" instead of "not equipped to tackle the material". as a result, being able to inspire them to pull the trigger on their plans, follow their intuition, etc, is way better for their dvevelopment and overall effectivness/learning rate, than being able to give them a perfect, complete, crystalized answer that handles all the edge cases.

Other things I'd immediately add to the list, in no immediate order or category:

- Startups are CRAZY. Things are constantly being tweaked in ways the onsite isn't, often to figure out logistical issues. Working for the remote beta program provides me a level of insulation. The hours aren't crazy, and my responsibilities aren't always mission critical every second of the day, but it's immensely educational to see new systems get put in place, and problems get solved at rapid pace, resulting in positive student outcomes.
- It's easy to think of technical skill as the core value of an engineer, where as long as they have enough depth of experience, they'll be good. It turns out, the best engineers avoid that pitfall by becoming awesome at communicating/articulating complex ideas. Not only that, but accurately arguing for their intuitions so the right decision gets made, even if not everything immediately agrees.
- Like the individual and team, the company is constantly learning, evolving, and growing. Watching Hack Reactor run has opened my eyes to this. 
- I understand how powerful delegating can be. Seeing patterns in the most effective people: from senior engineers I've had the good fortune to observe, to Hack Reactor's senior staff. 
- Communication skills, brevity, the power of delegation.
- Having an awesome product, and supporting it with all of your resources, is worthi t.


I'll check in when I'm closer to the end of the role.


Part IV: 


VISA: Call to action
(visa)
As I don't have a bachelor's degree in CS and no other work experience in the industry. I can't legally work in the states. It is exhilarating and always motivating to see my, who are my technical peers, getting amazing offers at companies they're excited to work for. It's a validation of all my hard work, knowing I'm good enough for jobs like that. The salary stats (99%, $105k) are real, and if anything dialed down so H/R can argue more comprehensively around inevitable edge-case arguments.

Without access to that job market, I'll always be taking a massive pay cut.
The silver lining here is that I don't need to worry about optimizing for money, because I can't. I can focus more intently on learning from those around me, and picking roles that are best for that.


**It's a remote contract role. Hit me up if you're hiring (remote or otherwise) in the Bay Area. I'll reach out when it ends.

Hack Reactor, as it is today, is the product of a long journey from tiny startup serving a class of 7, to elite engineering academy.

Dennis Lin was a graduate from the cohort before me. He has a CS degree and has taught university level CS topics for years. Now a Software Engineer at Exabeam, he said: "This is how a CS program should be done" in his review. 

Dennis Lin: big learning moment. Empathy and conflict resolution..


Dealing with burnout. Being tired all the time, but still energized. 

Pulling an all-nighter, sleeping for 3 hours in a corner, and having a full 12 hour day right after, barelly noticing I was tired.
Learning a tough lesson about how all-nighters are unsustainable, and even if massively personally productive, sap morale on a team and are generally unsustainable...


Raw hours pair programming. Being able to talk, effectively communicate, and now effectively write.

There was time not so long ago when a blog post like this would intimidate the hell out of me.  I could ramble and converse like the best, and even now my writing style is quite conversational, but making an elaborate point, training my skills as a writer. 
I'm basically applying things I've read about it books, but can do it because of the skills I've learned being a self directed learner, being able to push through nervousness and uncertainty, to move quickly and iterate quickly on my hunches.



People skills. Learning how to contribute and learn, both as the smartest and dumbest person in the room. Transcending those judgemetns so you can see where, even if there's a disparity in some traits/metrics, your team members have strengths in other areas. Seeking those areas out, and killing it.

On impostor Syndrome, and how H/R helps kill it.

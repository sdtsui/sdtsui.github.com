The Time is Right for Remote Work
-adv, alone w/ thoughts
-commute


Main challenge:
-Going from synchronous to asynch collab; restructure work technique.
-Once that hump is passed, home office can accomodate whoever. (IF)


-We believe: the luxury privilege of the next 20yrs will be to leave the city. Not as its leashed servant in a suburb, but to wherever one wants.
-Old money vs hip-money luxuries....coin given in exchange for endless hours spent at the office.
-New luxury is the luxury of freedom and time...once you've had a taste of that life, no corner office or fancy chef will be able to drag you back


Great talent is everywhere:
-don't have a single employee in SF
-"star employees who work away from the echo chambers of industry spend far less time brooding about how much greener the grass is on the other side, and generally, seem happier in their work"

: advantages are freedom, time, money.
Compromise:
-loss of imposed structure and regiment...
-requires a new level of personal commitment..to stick with an alternative work frame. 
  -more responsibility..natural procrastinators have issues
-spouse can be like coworkers...


...drawing the parallel between other critical business activities that companies outsource. Why not let 'insiders' do the same critical activities outside?



Chapter (30): dealing with excuses
-notion that everyone needs to be in the room: vidchat gets 98%. 2x/yr meetings do the rest.
-making sure that they're all working: they're fucking off @ work anyway
-People's homes are full of distractions...gotta create systems & environments
-who will answer the phone: exceptions that work. small price to pay for freedom. can also cover more around the clock..
-It's a challenge, and you need confidence! Big companies do it too (weak argument here)
-It's not fair, others would get jealous: poor argument because every must suffer? don't send to siberia, rollout a whole team and measure results

-We paid for a big office: IGNORE SUNK COST
-LOTS OF INDUSTRIES ALREADY DO IT



HEALTH ISSUES:
-ergonomics.
-don't isolate: people still NEED social interaction. find ways to get outside, whatever city you're in.
-remote workers: FATTER. put office money into gym and food reimbursements.

Embrace overlap; SOME delay is required, but indian outsourcing had bad reputation for 1day turnaround for communication.
---KEY: 4ish hours of intersection...
---open (github), know schedules, know state of work
---slack: wasting time; creates cohesion; virtual watercooler
---weekly progress/discussion threads


Cost of thriving:
-instead of thinking: pay people from Kansas less money
-Pay people from Kansas new york salaries, they can't leave..
-By the same token, as a remote worker, you shouldn't let employers get away with paying you less just because you live in a cheaper city. "Equal pay for equal work" miht be a dusty slogan, but it works for a reason.

-Keeping employees...don't let a divorce or desire for a change of scenery kill retention. Often they want to stay.
"Doing great owrk with great people is one of the most durable sources of happiness we humans can tap into. Stick with it."

On hirnig:
-remote work exposes what was always the case
-Joel Spolsky: "geurilla guide to interviewing": Smart, gets things done.
-when the work product is out in the open, it's easier to see who is actually smart, vs sounds smart...
-Open product: "Remote work speeds up the process of getting the wrong people off the bus and the right people on board."

Test projects: 1 week. 15000.
No interview puzzles.
MUST meet them in person, usually over lunch...-acclamated with the team...after hiring, invite for first few weeks @ office



CONTRACTORS ARE A GREAT TEST DRIVE


Best time to go remote:
-Start early....as early as possible. Cultures grow over time.
-Otherwise, best option is a low risk experiement...

Manager's role: not herd cats. Lead/verify work-Don't manage chairs...
-Meetups and sprints, regular, to re sync the team. Industry conferences.


Open Source:
Lessons:
-all in the pen
-meeting occasionally, or support own conferences/sessions @ general ones
-intrinsic motivation

Level the playing field: make sure remote workers aren't 2nd class citizens. crappy tech, communication issues with onsite, etc.


-Check-ins/1-on-1s: reguarly. Just chat. See what's up.


**If work is all-consuming, workers will burn out** this is  the real risk, not laziness...
Best workers over the long term put in sustainable hours. 40h/wk usually does the tricky...


-gives facetime additional, special value...
-makes facetime insanely productive.
-creates scarcity/productivity boosts, without losing baseline productivity...


LIFE AS A REMOTE WORKER:
-separate office. separate life.
-demarke work and play...suggesting "looking presentable". Work set and home set of slippers.
-confining work to a home office.


MOTIVATION:
-For some people: Harder to get in the flow when in complete isolation...except don't want real interruptions. White noise of crowd helps. Coffeeship.

-Alfie Kohn: Punished by Rewards...threats are really ineffective...

Enables "When I retire I'm going to travel the world"
-Choice: Luxury to see the world without being independently wealthy, or giving up your career---Designers: change of scenery translates to NEW IDEAS IN HIS WORK..


Standing out as a remote worker, making usre you're not ignored:

-PRODUCT AWESOME WORK
-Make noise


list of tools.
-view of remote as a future
-old habit of remote as not quite there..yet?

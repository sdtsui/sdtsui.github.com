Ryan Leung is a friend and fellow Hacker in Residence at [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com)'s Remote Beta program.  He runs a daily toy problem lecture to students in the morning, fields a variety of tough technical questions every day, and keeps the students' spirits up with awesome music recommendations. He's also a fellow Canadian, hailing from Montreal, Quebec. I'm excited to blog for Ryan, and look forward to future opportunities to work with him.

This blog post will be a bit of a smorgasboard of cool CS stuff I've been working on over the last few weeks with fellow HiR Clark Feusier.
Our project's codename is "immutable-harmony", and attempts to 



Main points:


Functional programming really helps you write clean code.
Link to debugging post (why we don't use immutable). 
Of only for that reason, the time I've invested thinking about data structures as they pertain to this project has been well worth it. 


-Stuff I learned:
Getting started
Func programming course on ES6...

ES6 with domo Sr Frontend...

Finally, working with Clark on immutable harmony. 


ON FUNCTIONAL:
I understand much better now, the trade off inherent in functional vs object oriented paradigms, and have had a chance to appreciate the freedom a more functional style gives you. Not having to think about side effects is a real blessing.



I think of it like, different styles are suited to different things.  Like styles or stances in martial arts. I guess I'm crimping a l



ON ES6: 
Can't wait to keep learning. It's a great opportunity. 
More than anything, it's encouraging to see web technologies continue to evolve. I'm enthusiastic about my involvement in this industry.


ON IMMUTABLE:
When I started this project, I really had no idea how this stuff worked. 
I didn't get that an immutable structure's method might end up returning itself, instead of some work that it did in an object oriented way. 
It's been great.

I'm going to be crazy motivated to 
Eyeing "functional programming in  scala" for my next course...

This post is a bit of a blast from the past. Short blog about a useful tool.
At various points while working on projects I've found a need to _____play w data,or populate an application with relevant data (more commonly).

Kimono has been a great tool for me.

I did a tiny test visualization in D3 using it, which you can see here.

I took the data from the following wikipedia page, using the instrucitons on the top right. (link to page) Painless process saving the JSON.

They have a free tier which essentially covers the use case I outlined above, but have a nice paid tier for auto-scraping if you need it for something persistent. Enjoy!

General notes:

I went into H/R with a vague notion that these skills were vlauable, I'd better learn them well
no job guarantees, no visa prospects.

No bachelor's degree.
2 years of a stats degree.

A lot of good wishes
you're a good kid, you'll do fine.
I know lots ofp eople who sponsor...
lots of observation bias here. IT IS HARD.
95% of the job market is out.


No degree, you tell your story super well...



Options:
contract.
Remote (which is contract)
onsite, outside of the US


12 years = 1yr work experience


checklist of things to do
Create a quiz.

Etc.


Get the maximum amount of money
continue learning
HiR value...



Foreign nationals would sorely benefit from HiR. If you can afford it. 
It's basically...a ton of cred back home. You're from SF. You've worked in SF. 
You have a network of people, stay friends with your cohort, crush it. 


My job outcome:

During the course: just work hard, you'll be fine. Be a standout candidate. 
even if I didn't know 95% of the job market wasn't available to me, I focused and in a way it narrowed things. Allowed me to learn a lot of the things I needed.

I took DS/algos and whiteboarding seriously and am super confident in tech interviews now.
I went above and beyond the curriculum...tihnking about that stuff. HackerRank problems are great, if non-user friendly (welcome to the rest of your life), but also stuff like IH, about data structures.

So after I get HiR I get some real talk with Adrian. Like a real engineer, he whiteboards out my options for me. Outlines how hard it is to do without a degree.

With a degree? Easier? Apply hard. Basically be awesome and someone will pick you up...but have backups, continue learning...do a lot of awesome shit.




HIR was amazing. really helped. Technical mentoring.
Lots of time

BIG TIMESINK: 
Carve out research tasks/sprints, asking people for advice and whiteboariing out your options
It's really hard to be consistently coding while juggling visa thought sand shit. 

I made every mistake possible. Attended VC pitches. Went to an interview or two. Generally jus wrote crap quality code, stunted my learning rate, and wasn't able to spend extra cycles helping improve the HR expereince or just resting/enjoying myself.
 USE SPRINTS, never let them take longer than a day or two, 

 leave 1-2 weeks before HiR ends to half ass your project stuff , because it is good to figure this out. It's like a gap in your resume, you enter this game with a handicap and need to write a 2nd cover letter...to the visa guy to prepare. 

 Otherwise, CODE CODE CODE. That's the strategy guide to using HIR.

BIGGEST BENEFIT OF THIS PROCESS:
Applied a real lens to optimizing for my career goals. Tthinking about meta frame, my goals, what I want, what I want to do....
Settled on a search plan of:
-Frontend w/ optmiization focus (isntead of Ux/design), brach into either:
-Backend 
-or data viz - > data science

There's a general HiR strategy guide there.

This post is dated March 15th, the day I would have been graduating from Hack Reactor. Except I'm not. I'm writing this from my apartment in Vancouver, Canada. Preparing for the next step in my development as a software engineer...


"Hack Reactor teaches its students to like senior engineers."
"I really believe this is how CS programs should be taught."
"...Hack Reactor is the Harvard of them all [coding schools]."

A couple of choice quotes from the [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com) front page. I first heard about Hack Reactor 

I didn't expect it when I would be hired out of the program This is a picture of my last night at Hack Reactor, a week from graduation.

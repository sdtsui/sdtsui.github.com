Start with the conclusion: 
Be the best person you can be, on every level.
-Social
-Physical

It's not about Alpha. It's about being happy with yourself and others.
It's about bringing value, and getting value.

Elaborate:
-EVERY level, even things you wouldn't normally consider important. Consider all points of view.

  -Many different styles of Game.

-A million ways you can tweak: Different areas to focus on.

-Conflicting desires:
  -Roosh: The nerds will inherit the earth (would teach his kid programming); maybe simplistic, but he sees the trend
  -RationalMale: All we want to do is rest
  -What's the point? It's all dualistic conflcit anyway --- Heartiste's Curse of the Player

The Parting Shot: 
I'm doing the best I can. I show up every day. I'm constantly trying to tweak.
Shoot me a line if you think I can help you in some way.

-Functional style has been a joy. I feel like I'm slowly getting proficient.
-Reaching around and learning a functional style in immutable has been a joy.
  -Implementing a Heap and trying to figure out what to use was a challenge. The best choice ended up being right in front of me: a list, which was closest to an array. I'd be interested in doing some performence tests, perhaps against the NPM library, and my own semi-complete implementation.
  -Hold them up side-by-side?
  -That's a decent blog post idea...
    -Hmmm.


Thoughts that went into the heap implementation:
  Observation: It was hard to make sense of everything. With a lot of new information, look for help, clues, and guidance.
    I was lucky to be able to collaborate with Clark Feusier, without him I'd have struggle a lot more, had a lot less fun, etc.
  Lessons: 
    -Reach out for help.
    -Keep refactoring.
      -I think pseudocoding should be like the carpet bombing phase. Get your ideas out. Get them out fully. Accomplish the goal at hand.
      -But too often we carry that mindset into our implementation, when really we should be carefully writing well structure, readable code.
        -Make sure it's readable, make sure you can explain it and someone else could understand what you could do.
        -THEN, finally, make sure it works. Does wonders for catching bugs/bad naming before it even begins.
          Like Clark says, 3-4 lines, then refactor.

      Open question: What about over optimizing early when you plan the Pseudocoding stage?

-It's not quite like writing in another language. Maybe dialect is a good metaphor. You're constantly exploring, and thinking of ways to do new things.

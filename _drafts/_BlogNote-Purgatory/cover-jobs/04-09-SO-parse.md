Job Description

MailChimp is seeking a software engineer to help us build the MailChimp application. We don’t care about pedigree or what languages or stacks you’ve worked in, we’re just looking for great engineers. In fact, if you’d rather send us code than polish up your resumé, that works for us.

You’ll work with our product–development team to build new functionality into our product, and our customer–service team to resolve issues as they arise. You’ll be allowed—even required—to be creative in your work. We push managers and meetings out of the way so you can concentrate on what you love to do.

We’re looking for developers located anywhere, but who are willing to work in Atlanta. We allow for flexible hours and some telecommute options, but you need to be in the Atlanta office on a regular basis. We’ll help you with relocation.

Skills & Requirements

Ability to work independently, with minimal supervision
Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP environment
JavaScript, XML and AJAX
A portfolio of code you've written

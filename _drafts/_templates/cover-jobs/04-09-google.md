Thank you for your interest in our Software Engineering Internship positions. Our applications for the Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2015 openings have closed. We plan to post our Summer 2016 internship positions in early fall.

Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how millions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our ambitions reach far beyond just Search. Our products need to handle information at the the scale of the web. We're looking for ideas from every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, and user interface design; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you work on a small team and can switch teams and projects as our fast-paced business grows and evolves. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to tackle new problems as we continue to push technology forward.

As a key member of a small and versatile team, you design, test, deploy and maintain software solutions.

Software Engineers at Google are researchers and developers who yearn to create and implement complex computer science solutions. Our engineers develop massively scalable, distributed software systems and also collaborate on multitudes of smaller projects that have universal appeal - which requires research, awareness, interactivity, and asking questions. You build strong competencies in data structures and algorithms, along with a technical fascination for how stuff fits together. You need to have a solid foundation in computer science in order to consistently come up with new ideas as well as strive for a deep understanding of our products and services in order to continually improve upon them. We focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of engineers with the highest levels of technical depth, programming skills and a keen eye for quality.

As a Software Engineer, you will work on our core products and services as well as those who support critical functions of our engineering operations. Depending on your background and experience, you will be working in one of the following areas:

Product and Systems Development 

Whether it's finding new and innovative ways to advance search quality, building computing platform and networking technologies, automating the indexing of videos, or continuing to refine and scale complex auction systems (just to name a few), you will be developing solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems out there. You will research, conceive and develop software applications to extend and improve on Google's product offerings and collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data and information. Examples of specialist domains: UI development with AJAX and similar technologies, security, embedded systems and mobile apps (Android), developer tools (IDEs, large-scale build systems, compilers).

Engineering Productivity 

As a software engineer in the Engineering Productivity organization, you'll use your software design, analysis and programming skills to create innovative automated test systems. This isn't a job in which you'll simply debug and run test cases, in fact that only scratches the surface. The test team undertakes a broad range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent systems that can explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never been done before. There are no textbooks that can help you learn this, which is why we have some of the best and brightest engineers working in this group.

Site Reliability 

Software engineers working in Site Reliability are involved in every facet of Google's production and work on the cutting edge of cloud-based computing. As a member of this elite team you are in the thick of everything involved with keeping Google running, from code-level troubleshooting of traffic anomalies to maintenance of our most cutting edge services; from monitoring and alerts to building new automation infrastructure. Software engineers on this team love to create robust and scalable software that scale to tens of millions of users. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day, and work with just about every other engineering and operations team to provide services and applications that are quintessentially Google - fast, reliable and accessible to all.

Responsibilities
Perform specific responsibilities which vary by project area
Minimum qualifications
Currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or related technical discipline.
Preferred qualifications
Must be currently enrolled in a full time degree program and returning to the program after the completion of the internship.
Experience in systems software or algorithms.
Familiarity with TCP/IP and network programming.
Knowledge of Unix/Linux or Windows environments and APIs.
Excellent implementation skills (C++, Java, Python).
Area
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to tackle some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From AdWords to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem. Our mission is to progress, protect, and provide for the software and systems behind all of Google’s public services - Search, Ads, Gmail, Android, YouTube, and AppEngine, to name just a few - with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity. 

This is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. 

Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. At Google, we have the good fortune to have developed many interesting systems ranging from planet-spanning databases to near real-time scalable data warehousing to fault-tolerant datastream joining. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of continental-level service capacity, across a range of systems and a user population measured in billions. We own those products in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack. We literally do learn something new every day - usually surprising things - that have the potential to transform the lives of billions of our users around the world.

As a Software Engineer on the SRE team, you will have the opportunity to tackle the complex problems of scale which are unique to Google while using your expertise in coding, algorithms, complexity analysis and large-scale system design.

Opening date: April 2nd 2015

Closing date: May 4th 2015

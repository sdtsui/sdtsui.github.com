Siberia: Centered
As an Associate you will be asked to think on your feet, and continuously collaborate with the team to shape, imagine, and deliver new experiences. You'll work with your teammates to create user journeys, understand new platforms and concept product experiences.

This is an opportunity for someone who wants to gain diverse experience, learn everyday and make cool new things. Associates are our future Leads, and we'll work with you to make sure you are consistently challenged and growing.

You should be adept at not only developing experiences that sing, but at thinking through how they solve the business problem at hand while still making sense and providing value to the people that will use them. The daily challenges you face will not be those of bringing someone else’s designs to life, but of designing solutions that work for people. You are a creator of solutions, a hacker of problems and a lover of technology – as happy to test a single interaction 15 different ways as to dive into a new API and bolt together a quick proof of concept. You will be expected to be always learning about user experience paradigms and the technology services and evolutions that enable them.

Beauty and function are baked into everything we produce, so you will be expected to have an eye for design and opinions on its impact.

While we will be looking for programming proficiency, we're most interested in your hunger to improve your visual design while simultaneously honing your development skills.

As a Lead you will guide your clients and team in the development of new experiences and products. You will break down business and user problems, imagine new and beautiful solutions, and lead the process of bringing them to life.

Technology Leads are problem solvers for your clients and your teams. You will lead client projects in close collaboration with a design lead, creating products that solve client problems. You will break down business and user problems, imagine new and beautiful solutions, and bring great experiences to life. You need to not only be a versatile technologist, but you should also be committed to design and the creation of elegant experiences. You should be as comfortable with full days deep in code as you are with coaching an associate through the best method to structure a prototype.

Beauty and function are baked into everything we produce, so you will be expected to have an eye for design and opinions on its impact.

While we will be looking for extensive knowledge of technology and development we're most interested in your desire to lead from a core competency while continually exploring and extending your knowledge base.


As a Lead you will guide your clients and team in the development of new experiences and products. You will break down business and user problems, imagine new and beautiful solutions, and lead the process of bringing them to life.

Design Leads are a special blend of brand strategist, product manager, interaction designer, interface designer, business consultant and conceptual technologist. You should be able to switch seamlessly from discussing the business impact of an idea to designing pixel perfect interfaces. You are just as comfortable working on your own as you are leading and teaching the associate(s) on your team.

Prototypes and coded experiences are our primary output, so you should be comfortable talking, tweaking and negotiating code and technology.

While we will be looking for extensive knowledge of design, we're most interested in your desire to lead from a core competency while continually exploring and extending your knowledge base.

Software Developer
Los Angeles
The Cloud Foundry engineering team is looking for a few great engineers to join us in building an open source platform that transforms how the world deploys and scales software.

You

You love shipping features, but know that well factored code is what lets you keep shipping features in the long run.  Maybe you get antsy writing code without tests, or perhaps you’re a large-scale system operator interested in leveling-up your coding skills.

Either way, you judge your success by the success of your team; you are interested in learning about distributed systems; and you are excited to work on open source.

Us

Cloud Foundry is co-developed with Pivotal Labs, a leader in the field of agile software development. We are opinionated about how software should be built. We pair program, all-day every-day, because we know it delivers remarkable results. We work in small teams, and rotate between them frequently. We believe in working at a sustainable pace – you’ll typically code hard for 8 hours each day, but then you’re off work to relax, recharge, and refocus.

Where

Cloud Foundry engineering is located in San Francisco, in our SOMA office near 4th and Howard St.  To make sure you start your day energized, we provide a catered breakfast every weekday morning, and unlimited snacks/drinks are of course available all day. Our collaborative, open-plan office space is filled with talented, like-minded engineers who enjoy taking advantage of our weekly Tech Talks, playing ping pong, and hanging out with their co-workers.

Desired Skills/ Experience:

Operations or Systems Administration experience, particularly on UNIX. (You know what a daemon is and how to restart one. When the daemon won’t start because some other process is listening on the port it needs, you can find and kill the errant process.)
Experience and/or interest in Test Driven Development (TDD) and agile methodologies
Ability to dive into a polyglot codebase and contribute while learning
BA/BS in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent experience
 

We’re seeking more amazing developers to add to our team. Apply by sending us  resume and a cover letter.
